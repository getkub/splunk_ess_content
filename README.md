#  Contentctl Wrapper

A wrapper around the Splunk Content Control Tool (`contentctl`) to streamline and enhance security content management.

## Overview

This project provides a wrapper around Splunk's `contentctl` tool, simplifying and extending its functionality for more efficient security content development, validation, and deployment.

## Features

* **Simplified Workflows:** Provides easier-to-use commands and abstractions for common `contentctl` tasks.
* **Extended Functionality:** Adds new capabilities beyond the core `contentctl` tool, such as automated testing, reporting, or integration with other tools.
* **Customization:** Allows you to tailor the content management process to your specific needs and environment.

## Why This Wrapper?

* **Increased Efficiency:** Reduces the complexity and verbosity of using `contentctl` directly.
* **Improved Consistency:** Enforces standardized workflows and best practices.
* **Enhanced Automation:** Enables greater automation of content management tasks within your CI/CD pipeline.

## Core Functionality

refer to the  "python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt"  which is the  installation step in the Canvas.

The primary purpose of this command is to install the necessary dependencies for the project, as defined in the `requirements.txt` file. This file lists all the Python packages that your project relies on, including `contentctl` and any other libraries.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x
    * `contentctl` (installed separately)
    * Git

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repo_url>
    cd <your_repo_name>
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

    ```bash
    # Example usage of your wrapper commands
    mycontentctl --help
    mycontentctl validate
    mycontentctl deploy --target production
    ```

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`)

## Contributing

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/my-feature`).
5.  Submit a pull request.
